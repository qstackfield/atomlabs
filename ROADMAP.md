# Roadmap

**Atom Labs - Cognitive Security Infrastructure**

*This roadmap reflects current direction and priorities. It will evolve as the ecosystem grows.*

---

## Where We Are Today

The foundation is built and running in production.

- **LCAC** published with a citable DOI, deployed in a live financial environment
- **RIS** v1.0 live with an evaluation pipeline, scoring real models, CII dashboard active
- **ABE** formally specified with a patent application filed and public proof running
- **ATOM** deployed as a multi-tenant production platform with enterprise console

The stack is complete. The work now is visibility, adoption, and ecosystem building.

## Near Term - Visibility and Validation

**Standards engagement**  
Submit LCAC and RIS for consideration to NIST, ISO, and AI governance bodies as the field moves toward formal AI reasoning standards. The frameworks are designed to complement existing structures - this is a natural extension of work already underway at NIST AI RMF and the EU AI Act implementation level.

**Hackathons**  
Continue submitting ABE and related concepts to AI safety, governance, and infrastructure hackathons. Each submission is an independent validation of the thesis and expands the network of people who understand what this work does.

**Research publication**  
Expand the Zenodo record with additional papers on LCAC, RIS measurement methodology, and the formal properties of ABE. Build the academic citation trail.

**Community**  
Begin engaging the AI governance and AI safety communities on LinkedIn and GitHub. The RIS standard and the LCAC framework are designed to be adopted independently - not just as part of ATOM. Community engagement around the standards accelerates adoption of the platform.

## Medium Term - Ecosystem and Integration

**RIS Certification Program**  
Define a formal RIS Certification path for organizations and vendors. Structured similarly to SOC 2 or ISO 27001 audit engagements - producing a scored, auditable RIS report that organizations can use for procurement, compliance, and insurance purposes.

**Open Reference Implementation**  
Release a lightweight, open reference implementation of the LCAC cognitive boundary model and the ABE enforcement gate. Designed to run alongside any AI framework - LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI. Governance that integrates, not replaces.

**Provider Integrations**  
Deepen the provider ecosystem. Native integration packages for the major AI orchestration frameworks, enabling ATOM governance without a full platform deployment.

**Enterprise Pilot Program**  
Structured pilot engagements with organizations in financial services, healthcare, and defense - the three verticals where reasoning integrity failures carry the highest consequence.

## Longer Term - Infrastructure Layer

**The goal is for ATOM to become infrastructure** - the governance layer that organizations deploying autonomous AI don't build themselves, the same way they don't build their own firewalls or identity providers.

Cognitive security will become a standard enterprise requirement. The question is who builds the standard. The Atom Labs thesis is that the right foundation is a published, citable, auditable standard - LCAC and RIS - backed by a running platform with real production history.

**Potential paths:**
- Standalone enterprise SaaS - cognitive governance as a managed service
- Standards body - LCAC and RIS as independently-governed open standards
- Strategic partnership or acquisition - cognitive security layer embedded into an existing AI platform or enterprise security stack

All three paths are viable. The work that builds toward all of them is the same: strong published standards, a production platform with real deployment history, and a growing community that understands the problem.

## How to Engage

**If you're a researcher or engineer:** Open an issue, submit to the RIS portal, or reach out on GitHub. The standards are designed to be discussed and improved.

**If you're building with AI:** Try the ABE reference implementation. Run a RIS evaluation. See what you find.

**If you're in governance, risk, or compliance:** The RIS standard maps directly to frameworks you already use. Start there.

**If you're an investor or potential partner:** See [CREDENTIALS.md](./CREDENTIALS.md) and reach out directly.
