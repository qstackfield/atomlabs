## Professional Background

**Pentagon** - Cybersecurity architecture across defense information systems  
**NASA** - Security architecture for mission-critical infrastructure  
**Department of Defense** - Enterprise security frameworks and governance  
**Palo Alto Networks** - Enterprise cybersecurity, Zero Trust architecture

This background directly informs the Atom Labs thesis: the same rigor applied to network and identity security in defense environments must now be applied to AI cognition and execution.
